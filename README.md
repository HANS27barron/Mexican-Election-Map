# Mexcian Election Map

In this interactive web page, select your electoral year, hover or click on every state you want and find out which candidate won that state (and the rest of the podium). Each information widget ranks the winners and displays the total votes per party and its percentage in respect of the state. Similar to the Electoral College, each state will be painted in accordance to the winner´s party color. 

*This multi-platform application is available on all web browsers*
